### 2. Compatibility Flow

1. Provider submits Manifest to `CompatibilityEngine.validateAndCertify()`.
2. Engine verifies runtime version bounds via Semver logic.
3. Engine analyzes structural changes via API and Breaking Change detection.

### 3. API Compatibility Flow

1. Takes snapshots of the old interface and the new interface.
2. Identifies Removed, Added, Signature Changed, and Deprecated methods.

### 4. Semantic Version Flow

1. Verifies exact major version matching against supported constraints.
2. Ensures compatibility logic respects strict version boundaries.

### 5. Breaking Change Flow

1. Categorizes removed or modified API structures.
2. Triggers `BreakingChangeError` if violations are found.

### 6. Release Certification Flow

1. Generates Release Manifest with immutable hashes.
2. Verifies against Release Policy thresholds (e.g. Stable, LTS).
3. Signs Release Certificate with timestamp and platform signature.

### 7. Compatibility Matrix

Cross-verified capability matrix between Provider ID and Runtime Version.

### 8. Upgrade Planner Flow

Generates actionable upgrade path, warnings, and rollback strategies.

### 9. Deprecation Flow

Tracks end-of-life schedules and recommended replacement providers.

### 10. Release Manifest

Contains certified checksums, metadata, versions, and compatibility scores.

### 11. Release Certificate

Immutable cryptographic validation record of compatibility approval.

### 12. Security Checklist

- ✅ **Fail Closed**: Invalid compatibility stops the release.
- ✅ **Immutable Certificates**: Hashing and object freezing.
- ✅ **Version Strictness**: Major version matching enforced.
- ✅ **Checksums**: SHA-256 hashes for manifest integrity.
