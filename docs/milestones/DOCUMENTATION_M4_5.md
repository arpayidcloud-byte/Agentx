# AgentX M4.5 Documentation
## Cognitive Runtime Contracts

### 1. Implementation Report
The Cognitive Runtime Contracts (`@agentx/cognitive-contracts`) define the immutable standards, boundaries, and specifications that future Cognitive Intelligence Modules (M5) must implement. These contracts guarantee that advanced reasoning, decision-making, and reflection logic are strictly confined to their respective engines, maintaining Hexagonal Architecture, Dependency Injection principles, and Fail-Closed safety constraints without breaking the current Runtime Core, Workflow Engine, or Provider Layers.

### 3. Lifecycle Diagram
Lifecycle states are strictly dictated by `CognitiveLifecycle`, mapping transitions precisely:
`CREATED` → `INITIALIZING` → `THINKING` → `REASONING` → `REFLECTING` → `PLANNING` → `WAITING_APPROVAL` → `DECISION` → `EXECUTING` → `COMPLETED`

Fail-closed behaviors apply immediately on illegal state mutations.

### 4. State Machine & Contract Inventory
Every state and data exchange relies on strict immutability:
- `ThinkingSession`
- `ReasoningContext`
- `ThinkingState`
- `ThinkingSnapshot`

### 5. Reasoning & Event Contracts
The `ReasoningTrace` tracks decision steps, while the `Event SDK` ensures strict metadata compliance (trace propagation, timestamps, correlation IDs).

### 6. Safety, Budgets & Goal Contracts
- `CognitiveBudgetManager`: Enforces token and execution boundaries per engine phase.
- `SafetyPolicy`: Dictates confidence thresholds and human-in-the-loop gates.
- `GoalEngine` and `DecisionEngine`: Provide structured paths for objective resolution.

### 7. Memory & Prompt Contracts
Defines retrieval strategies across working, short-term, and long-term memory layers. Enforces prompt integrity and version management via `PromptTemplate`.

### 8. Validation
- **Deterministic Execution**: Enforces strict identical outputs from identical states.
- **Architecture Boundaries**: `CognitiveArchitectureValidator` forbids cognitive ports from directly importing concrete vendor implementations.

### 9. Security Checklist
- ✅ **Immutable Contracts**: Interfaces cannot be mutated post-initialization.
- ✅ **Strict Validation**: Lifecycle state machine rejects illegal transitions.
- ✅ **No Vendor Lock-in**: Interfaces purely defined by agent-agnostic contracts.
- ✅ **Fail-Closed Safety**: Budget violations and confidence drops throw immediate, blocking errors.
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Engines instantiated exclusively via factories/registries.

### 12. Architecture Freeze Compliance
Fully compliant with Architecture Freeze M4.4 constraints. Added additive interfaces without modifying Runtime core files.

### 13. Ready for M5 Checklist
- [x] Core cognitive interfaces frozen.
- [x] Memory, decision, and reflection boundaries documented.
- [x] Safety and budgeting constraints defined.
- [x] Lifecycle states strictly constrained.
- [x] Strict Testing suite validating all paths.
