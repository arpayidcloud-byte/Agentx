# AgentX M5.0 Documentation
## Cognitive Intelligence Kernel (CIK)

### 1. Implementation Report
The Cognitive Intelligence Kernel (`@agentx/cognitive-kernel`) successfully constructs the central orchestration layer for AgentX's cognitive evolution. It orchestrates Cognitive Engines, manages Thinking Sessions, and tracks Cognitive Lifecycle boundaries, Budget constraints, and immutable Checkpoints. It enforces deterministic execution limits and Fail-Closed policies to prevent system compromise. It does not implement any reasoning logic; instead, it exposes strictly validated ports to interface with M5.x engines.

### 3. Lifecycle Diagram & State Machine
Transitions strictly enforced across 16 discrete states.
Fails closed immediately upon invalid transitions (e.g., attempting `COMPLETED` without passing through `CHECKPOINTING`).

### 4. Session Model
Sessions are immutable during execution, isolated by `ThinkingSession`, providing strict boundaries for goal traces.

### 5. Checkpoint Model
`KernelCheckpointManager` creates and hashes immutable snapshots. Supports rapid rollback via `KernelRecoveryManager`.

### 6. Budget, Trace & Event Models
Budgets strictly enforced across 8 execution dimensions. Events emitted consistently follow the strict event contract (timestamps, traces, correlation IDs).

### 7. Recovery Model
Provides safe rollback to latest checkpoint. Supports recovery retries and lifecycle state restoration safely.

### 8. Security Checklist
- ✅ **Immutable Sessions**: Session state strictly protected.
- ✅ **Immutable Checkpoints**: Checkpoint snapshots are hashed and read-only.
- ✅ **Fail-Closed**: Budget violations and timeouts instantly stop operations.
- ✅ **Strict Validation**: All transitions are validated through the central state machine.
- ✅ **No Vendor Imports**: Kernel acts strictly on contracts.
