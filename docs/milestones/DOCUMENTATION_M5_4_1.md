# AgentX M5.4.1 Documentation
## Goal Intelligence Hardening & Planning Optimization (GIHPO)

### 1. Implementation Summary
Production-grade hardening pass on the Goal Intelligence package. Added deterministic cost estimation, constraint validation, goal provenance tracking, planning scoring, critical path analysis, integrity validation, and expanded metrics, hooks, and events. All additions are strictly backward-compatible.

### 2. File Inventory (New)
- goal-cost-estimator.ts
- goal-constraints.ts
- goal-provenance.ts
- planning-score.ts
- critical-path.ts
- goal-statistics.ts
- goal-integrity.ts

### 3. Architecture Diagram
```
Goal Intelligence Engine (Hardened)
    │
    ├── Goal Cost Estimator (Deterministic cost modeling)
    ├── Goal Constraints (Deadline, budget, token validation)
    ├── Goal Provenance (Immutable lineage tracking)
    ├── Planning Score (Complexity, risk, success estimation)
    ├── Critical Path Analyzer (Blocking tasks, parallel branches)
    ├── Goal Integrity Validator (Checksum and consistency)
    ├── Goal Statistics (Aggregate metrics collection)
    └── Enhanced Metrics, Hooks & Events
```

### 4. Goal Cost Estimation Flow
Subgoal count + dependency count + priority → Deterministic cost estimation covering execution time, CPU, memory, tokens, cost, risk, complexity, parallelism.

### 5. Constraint Validation Flow
Goal constraints validated BEFORE planning. Validates priority bounds, budget limits, execution time, token budgets, and deadlines. Fail-closed on any violation.

### 6. Goal Provenance Flow
Every goal maintains immutable provenance tracking: goalId, parentGoalId, originGoalId, reasoningTraceId, decisionId, learningPatternId, reflectionId, experienceId, checkpointId, checksum, version.

### 7. Planning Score Flow
Deterministic scoring of planning quality: complexity, risk, resource, dependency, parallelism, success estimation, quality grade (Excellent through Poor).

### 8. Critical Path Flow
Identifies critical path through planning graph: blocking tasks, slack time, longest dependency chain, parallel branches, execution layers.

### 9. Recovery Flow enhanced
PlanningRecoveryManager with checkpoint restoration, integrity verification, and recovery history tracking.

### 10. Metrics Model
Expanded to 20+ metrics including: PlanningScoreAverage, PlanningComplexityAverage, CriticalPathAverage, ConstraintViolationCount, IntegrityFailureCount, RecoverySuccessRate, EstimatedCostAverage, EstimatedRiskAverage, GoalTreeDepthAverage, PlanningValidationTime.

### 11. Security Checklist
- ✅ Fail Closed: Constraint violations throw GoalValidationError
- ✅ Immutable Goal Trees, Checkpoints, Provenance with SHA-256
- ✅ Deterministic ordering
- ✅ Dependency Injection only
- ✅ No singleton, no shared mutable state
- ✅ Strict TypeScript, zero any
