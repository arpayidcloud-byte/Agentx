# AgentX M5.3 Documentation
## Cognitive Learning & Adaptive Feedback (CLAF)

### 1. Implementation Summary
The Cognitive Learning & Adaptive Feedback layer (`@agentx/cognitive-learning`) successfully implements deterministic, symbolic learning capabilities on top of the Cognitive Kernel (M5.0), Reasoning Framework (M5.1), and Foundational Reasoning Algorithms (M5.2). The system learns from execution traces, reasoning outcomes, feedback, and patterns without using probabilistic methods, neural networks, or external AI models.

### 4. Learning Flow
1. Experiences collected into immutable store
2. Experience Extractor identifies patterns (repeated failures/successes)
3. Pattern Engine discovers frequent reasoning paths
4. Reflection Engine analyzes each experience for improvement
5. Adaptation Engine generates strategy adjustments
6. Improvement Engine produces recommendations
7. Checkpoint created for rollback capability

### 5. Pattern Discovery Flow
- Repeated failures: aggregated when >=2 failures exist
- Repeated successes: aggregated when >=2 successes exist
- Frequent paths: detected when same reasoning trace appears >=2 times

### 6. Feedback Flow
- Success: +5 confidence delta
- Failure: -5 confidence delta
- Approval: +3 confidence delta
- Rejection: -8 confidence delta

### 7. Reflection Flow
Each experience triggers post-execution reflection answering:
- What happened?
- Could another strategy perform better?
- What should be remembered?

### 8. Adaptation Flow
Policies control adaptation aggressiveness:
- **Conservative**: No automatic adaptations
- **Balanced**: Adapts on repeated failures
- **Aggressive**: Adapts on repeated success and failures
- **Strict**: Explicit approval required for adaptations

### 9. Improvement Flow
Improvements generated for:
- Repeated failures: Increase validation
- Repeated successes: Continue current approach

### 10. State Machine
CREATED → COLLECTING → EXTRACTING → PATTERN_ANALYSIS → REFLECTION → ADAPTATION → VALIDATION → CHECKPOINTING → COMPLETED

All transitions fail-closed on invalid states.

### 11. Metrics Model
- learningRuns, patternsLearned/Rejected, feedbackProcessed
- reflectionsCreated, adaptationsGenerated, improvementsGenerated
- averageConfidenceDelta, successRate, failureRate

### 12. Security Checklist
- ✅ Immutable learning history (experiences frozen)
- ✅ Immutable reflections (frozen objects)
- ✅ Immutable patterns (checksum-validated)
- ✅ Fail Closed: Invalid transitions → LearningStateError
- ✅ Dependency Injection only
- ✅ No singleton: All components instance-isolated
- ✅ No shared mutable state
- ✅ Checksum validation on experiences and patterns
- ✅ Session isolation
- ✅ Strict TypeScript: Zero `any`

### 13. Performance Considerations
- 43 tests execute in ~26ms
- Pattern discovery is O(n) on experience count
- Reflection is O(n) on experience count
- No external dependencies beyond cognitive-contracts

### 14. Coverage Report
```text
Statements: 99.6% ✅
Branches: 97.22% ✅
Functions: 100% ✅
Lines: 99.6% ✅
```
*Test Count: 43/43 Passed*

### 15. RFC Mapping
- RFC-0008: Stability & Quality Requirements
- RFC-0038: Cognitive Intelligence Integration
- RFC-0042: Strict TypeScript

### 16. ADR Mapping
- ADR-001: Separation of concerns
- ADR-002: Hexagonal Architecture ports
- ADR-003: Strict Interfaces over implementations

### 17. Remaining Work (M5.4)
- Integrate cognitive learning results with runtime execution planning
- Add cross-session learning aggregation
- Implement learning-driven workflow optimization
