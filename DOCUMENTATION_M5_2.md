# AgentX M5.2 Documentation
## Foundational Reasoning Algorithms (FRA)

### 1. Implementation Report
The Foundational Reasoning Algorithms (`@agentx/reasoning-algorithms`) successfully establishes deterministic, reproducible, and symbolic reasoning capabilities for the AgentX Cognitive Layer. It builds upon M5.1 (Reasoning Framework) by implementing rigorous symbolic logic engines such as Forward Chaining, Backward Chaining, Decision Trees, Graph Engines, and Hypothesis Evaluators without embedding probabilistic or non-deterministic LLMs.

### 4. Reasoning Flow
1. Symbolic logic executes strictly via Forward or Backward Chaining.
2. Cycles are prevented through graph cycle detection.
3. Conflicts are resolved based strictly on priority/weight policies.
4. Reasoning traces and snapshots are securely validated and stored.

### 5. Forward Chaining Diagram
Input facts and rule sets are evaluated continuously until a fixed point (no new inferences) is reached. Strict determinism applies.

### 6. Backward Chaining Diagram
Target Goal is verified recursively against the Fact Base. Evidence paths are fully explored before asserting goal truth.

### 7. Decision Tree & Graph Diagrams
Trees are validated for correct branch mapping. Graphs enforce Topological Sort ordering with immediate error throwing on cyclic dependencies.

### 8. Confidence Calculation Flow
Confidence is mathematically mapped based on evidence count, missing facts, contradiction ratios, and conflict weights.

### 9. Conflict Resolution Flow
Conflicting rules are resolved deterministically based on the chosen policy (Priority, Weight, or Latest).

### 10. Checkpoint & Recovery Flow
Checkpoint hashes ensure that recovery accurately restores symbolic execution backtracking without data corruption.

### 11. Metrics Model
Exposes metrics for Reasoning Runs, Graph Nodes/Edges, Conflicts, and Confidence Averages to the Kernel observability hooks.

### 12. Security Checklist
- ✅ **Fail Closed**: Cycles and rule integrity validation immediately throw errors.
- ✅ **Determinism**: No randomness, hidden state, or side-effects.
- ✅ **Strict TypeScript**: Zero `any` types and explicitly typed interfaces.
- ✅ **Dependency Injection**: Engines injected via Reasoning Registry.
- ✅ **No Vendor Lock-in**: Strict implementation of cognitive contracts.
