# AgentX M5.5 Documentation
## Autonomous Workflow Execution & Multi-Goal Orchestration (AWEMGO)

### 1. Implementation Summary
The Autonomous Workflow Execution & Multi-Goal Orchestration layer (`@agentx/workflow-orchestration`) transforms AgentX from a deterministic planner into a deterministic autonomous executor. It coordinates multiple goals simultaneously while maintaining strict safety, determinism, explainability, and fail-closed behavior through comprehensive state machines, resource management, and multi-goal orchestration.

### 2. File Inventory (35+ files)
- Core: workflow-orchestrator.ts, workflow-session.ts, workflow-state.ts, workflow-engine.ts
- Graph: workflow-builder.ts, workflow-validator.ts, workflow-graph.ts
- Execution: workflow-executor.ts, workflow-monitor.ts, workflow-scheduler.ts, workflow-dispatcher.ts, workflow-router.ts, workflow-queue.ts
- Coordination: multi-goal-manager.ts, goal-conflict-detector.ts, resource-allocator.ts, resource-validator.ts, resource-budget.ts
- Policy: execution-policy.ts, execution-validator.ts, replanning-engine.ts, replanning-policy.ts
- Tracking: progress-tracker.ts, execution-history.ts, decision-log.ts
- Infrastructure: workflow-barrier.ts, workflow-merger.ts, workflow-splitter.ts, workflow-dependency.ts, workflow-priority.ts
- Management: workflow-checkpoint.ts, workflow-recovery.ts, workflow-history.ts, workflow-statistics.ts, workflow-metadata.ts
- Integration: events.ts, hooks.ts, metrics.ts, index.ts

### 4. State Machine
14 states with strict fail-closed transitions:
CREATED → BUILDING → VALIDATING → READY → SCHEDULING → DISPATCHING → EXECUTING → MONITORING → CHECKPOINTING → REPLANNING → COMPLETED/FAILED/CANCELLED

### 5. Multi-Goal Orchestration
Supports simultaneous goals with priority-based scheduling, resource conflict detection, and deterministic goal lifecycle management (register, suspend, resume, complete, cancel).

### 6. Resource Management
- **ResourceAllocator**: CPU, memory, worker, token, and execution slot allocation
- **ResourceValidator**: Prevents over-allocation (fail-closed)
- **ResourceBudgetManager**: Tracks consumption against configured limits

### 7. Metrics Model
30+ metrics including: WorkflowsCreated, WorkflowsCompleted, GoalsRunning, TasksExecuted, TasksFailed, SchedulerLatency, ReplanningCount, ConflictCount, RecoveryCount, SuccessRate, FailureRate.

### 8. Security Checklist
- ✅ Fail Closed: Resource exhaustion immediately rejected
- ✅ Immutable Workflow Graph with SHA-256 checksums
- ✅ Immutable Execution History and Decision Log
- ✅ Strict Dependency Injection
- ✅ No singleton, no shared mutable state
- ✅ Strict TypeScript, zero `any`
