# AgentX M4.3 Documentation
## Native Vendor Integration Layer (NVIL)

### 1. Implementation Report
The Native Vendor Integration Layer has been successfully built. It bridges the existing Adapter Interfaces (`IQueueProvider`, `ILockProvider`, etc.) with real-world vendor SDKs using `IConfigurationProvider` for secure, injection-based setups. All native providers are encapsulated in `@agentx/native-providers`.

### 3. Sequence Diagram
1. Runtime requests provider from `ProviderRegistry`.
2. Registry resolves corresponding native adapter.
3. Native adapter initialized securely via `IConfigurationProvider`.
4. Operations execute via underlying SDK wrappers.

### 4. Deployment Diagram
Runtime instances are deployed in `Kubernetes Pods`.
Credentials are stored externally (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and injected into pods via `IConfigurationProvider` environment bridges.

### 5. Provider Flow
1. Configuration Loaded
2. Native Adapter Instantiated
3. Vendor Connection Verified via Health Check
4. Execution of queue/lock/storage actions
5. Telemetry & Audit Emitted

### 6. Retry Flow
Each vendor adapter implements internal vendor-specific retry logic (e.g. BullMQ attempts, Redis retries) mapped to the agent retry policies.

### 7. Circuit Breaker Flow
Vendor adapters expose health statuses that feed into the Adapter Layer's `ProviderFailoverManager` and `ProviderHealthMonitor`.

### 8. Telemetry Flow
All native providers utilize the `OTELTelemetryProvider` to inject distributed traces, metrics, and logs.

### 9. Security Checklist
- ✅ **Fail Closed**: Unconfigured providers throw errors.
- ✅ **No Secrets Hardcoded**: Environment Injection only.
- ✅ **Strict DI**: Vendors resolved via Adapter interfaces.
- ✅ **Vendor Isolation**: No vendor SDK logic spills into Runtime Core.
- ✅ **Strict TypeScript**: No hidden `any`.
