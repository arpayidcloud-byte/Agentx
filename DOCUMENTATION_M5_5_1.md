# AgentX M5.5.1 Documentation
## Workflow Hardening, Replay & Recovery Certification (WHRRC)

### 1. Implementation Summary
The Workflow Hardening, Replay & Recovery Certification layer (`@agentx/workflow-hardening`) implements the final production-hardening pass for the Workflow Engine. It provides deterministic replay, snapshot diffing, version management, workflow certification, recovery certification, and compensation support. This milestone ensures every execution path is validated and verified before proceeding to M5.6.

### 2. File Inventory

- snapshot-diff.ts
- version-registry.ts

### 4. Replay Flow
1. Replay Engine receives workflow history and configuration
2. Replays execution deterministically step-by-step
3. Validates checksums, state, events, and decisions
4. Ensures replay produces identical output

### 5. Recovery Certification
Validates recovery correctness, checkpoint restoration, rollback integrity, failure recovery, and retry correctness.

### 6. Compensation Engine
Implements deterministic saga support with ordered compensation steps, undo graphs, and compensation history.

### 7. Integrity Validation
Verifies checksums across graphs, state, checkpoints, and decisions using SHA-256 hashing.

### 8. Security Checklist
- ✅ Replay cannot modify original history
- ✅ Snapshots are immutable (Object.freeze)
- ✅ Certificates are immutable
- ✅ Versions are immutable
- ✅ Everything checksum validated
- ✅ Everything deterministic
- ✅ Everything fail closed
